# WASM, WAT?

![WebAssembly Logo](/assets/posts/wasm_logo.png){: width="100" }

WebAssembly - low-level assembly-like language that can be targeted by languages like C, Cpp, Rust, C# able to run at near-native speeds.

WebAssembly was released in March of 2017.

As a web developer, I've never really used it in real projects because there wasn't much to do with it in an average web project.

Today there is [great support](https://webassembly.org/features/){: target="_blank" rel="nofollow } across major browsers. The first best time to learn about this was in 2017, the second best time is today.

# What to do with it?

Popular libraries are being ported to wasm like:
- FFmpeg
- OpenCV
- AI frameworks

Our home computers have plenty of power to run intensive tasks locally. Doing light video editing, converting files, and running machine learning models are a few ideas that can be done right now with WASM.

ü´µ **WASM exposes you to new tools and languages**

For the exploration's sake. How cool is it that C/Rust/Go code can be run on the web? I'm currently poking around Rust and Go because of that.

Let's get technical now.

# WAT

WAT - **WebAssembly Text Format**

Text format for Humans to understand the compiled code.
Useful for debugging and understanding what it looks like.

WebAssembly programs are composed of modules. A module is a fundamental building block in the WebAssembly code.

To compose a program we need to learn about [S-expressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S-expression){: target="_blank" rel="nofollow }. Parenthesized expressions are composed of trees. Nesting S-expressions is what we need to do to create something useful here.

An example from [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly/Understanding_the_text_format#calling_the_function){: target="_blank" rel="nofollow }:

```wat
(module
  (func $add (param $lhs i32) (param $rhs i32) (result i32)
    local.get $lhs
    local.get $rhs
    i32.add)
  (export "add" (func $add))
)
```

I think you can understand what is going on here but I'll say it anyway: adding 2 integer numbers.

A func declares a new function with the name `$add` and with function arguments  `$lhs`, and `$rhs` with the param keyword and the returning type with the result keyword.

Execution operates on the stack. We push `$lhs` to the stack then we push `$rhs` to the stack and after calling `i32.add` we will pop both of these variables from the stack, add them and push back the result.

‚úÖ So we've got our WAT program.

Can we run it as it is?

üö´ Not yet.

What is runnable inside browsers or other runtimes is WebAssembly binary - `.wasm`

To compile WAT ‚û°Ô∏è WASM we can use tools like [wat2wasm](https://github.com/WebAssembly/wabt){: target="_blank" rel="nofollow } or see interactive [one here](https://webassembly.github.io/wabt/demo/wat2wasm/){: target="_blank" rel="nofollow }.

Now after we have compiled the `.wasm` file we can simply call it from JavaScript.

```html
<script>
  WebAssembly.instantiateStreaming(fetch("add.wasm")).then((obj) => {
    console.log(obj.instance.exports.add(1, 2)); // "3"
  });
  // Note: The exported function name matches the name in the WAT export above.
</script>
```

Adding numbers is not impressive I know.

But the real value here is to encourage you ü´µ to explore WebAssembly on your own.

There is a lot of going on right now:
- [WASI](https://wasi.dev/) Effort to standardize running WebAssembly outside browsers.
- [Wasmtime](https://wasmtime.dev/) Runtime that builds upon WASI design.
- [WebGPU and Wasm](https://github.com/juj/wasm_webgpu) Bridging the gap between GPU and WASM.
- [WasmEdgeRuntime](https://wasmedge.org/) WasmEdge is a lightweight WebAssembly runtime for cloud-native, edge, and decentralized applications.
